Hi all!

We are launching a blog post series on topics relevant to people following our startup journey. From technical topics 
like building high availability apps in Kubernetes to nontechnical ones, like our experience in some of the accelerators
we have been through.

Overall, we hope you will enjoy the content, and of course, you are more than encouraged to propose some topics you 
would like to see here on our Discord.

Also, if you are interested in contributing to our project, you can find open issues on our GitHub repository, and while
you are there, give it a star :star:

**Blog posts coming soon...**
