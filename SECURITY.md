# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps to report it to us:

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue. Security issues must be reported privately via email.

1. Email us at [info@cyclops-ui.com](mailto:info@cyclops-ui.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
2. Include information about how the vulnerability can be reproduced or exploited.
3. Provide any relevant documentation, code snippets, or steps to help us understand and reproduce the issue.

Our team will acknowledge your email within [time frame] and will work with you to address the issue. We appreciate your responsible disclosure and will keep you informed about the progress of fixing the vulnerability.

## Supported Versions

Since we currently don't have any official releases, we do not have specific versioning to provide support for. However, security issues reported will be addressed in the latest development code.

## Security Measures

While we are actively working on developing our project, we are committed to maintaining security best practices:

- Regular code reviews by our development team.
- Integration of automated testing to catch common vulnerabilities.
- Continuous monitoring of dependencies for security updates.

## Security Updates

As we start releasing official versions, we will include security updates and advisories in our release notes. Until then, any security-related updates will be communicated directly to anyone who has reported a security issue.

We appreciate your understanding as we work to improve the security of our project.

Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping to make our project secure.
